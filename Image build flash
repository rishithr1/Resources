Perfect 👍 — these three words are among the most frequently used terms in BSP / DiagOS / ONIE / Firmware work:

Image • Build • Flash

You hear them daily because they describe the software creation → deployment → installation pipeline on hardware.

Let’s explain each deeply, clearly, with real-life examples and switch context.

⸻

🧭 Big Picture First — How They Relate

Source Code
    ↓
BUILD
    ↓
IMAGE created
    ↓
FLASH to device
    ↓
System boots

So:
	•	Build = Create software
	•	Image = Final packaged file
	•	Flash = Write it into hardware storage

Now deep dive each.

⸻

1️⃣ BUILD

Simple Definition

Build = Process of converting source code into a runnable system/software.

You take:
	•	Code
	•	Configs
	•	Drivers
	•	Kernel

And compile them into binaries.

⸻

Real-Life Analogy 🏭

Build = Manufacturing a car.

Raw materials:
	•	Steel
	•	Engine parts
	•	Electronics

Factory assembles → Final car produced.

Source code = Raw material
Build system = Factory
Image = Finished car

⸻

What Happens During Build

Example DiagOS build:

Compile kernel
Compile drivers
Compile tools
Create filesystem
Package everything

All automated via Makefiles/scripts.

⸻

Commands You Run

make
make diagos
make onie

This triggers build process.

⸻

2️⃣ IMAGE

Simple Definition

Image = Final packaged software file produced after build.

It contains everything needed to boot system.

⸻

What’s Inside an Image

Example DiagOS image contains:
	•	Kernel (vmlinuz)
	•	Root filesystem
	•	Drivers
	•	Libraries
	•	Test tools
	•	Config files

All bundled together.

⸻

File Formats You’ll See

Image Type	Extension
DiagOS	.bin / .img
ONIE	.onie
NOS	.bin
Disk image	.qcow2
Firmware	.rom


⸻

Real-Life Analogy 💿

Image = Windows ISO file.

You download ISO → install OS.

Same concept.

⸻

3️⃣ FLASH

Simple Definition

Flash = Writing an image into hardware storage memory.

Storage types:
	•	SPI flash
	•	eMMC
	•	SSD
	•	NOR/NAND flash

⸻

Real-Life Analogy 📱

Flashing = Installing Android/iOS into phone memory.

Without flashing → phone has no OS.

⸻

Flashing Flow in Switch

Have ONIE image
     ↓
Flash into SPI/eMMC
     ↓
Bootloader updated
     ↓
Switch boots ONIE


⸻

🔧 Flash Tools / Methods

Common methods:
	•	USB flashing
	•	Network flashing
	•	JTAG flashing
	•	ONIE installer flashing
	•	BIOS flashing

⸻

4️⃣ Putting All Together

Let’s combine build → image → flash.

⸻

Example — DiagOS Workflow

Clone source code
      ↓
BUILD DiagOS
      ↓
diag-os.bin IMAGE created
      ↓
FLASH image to switch / QEMU disk
      ↓
Boot DiagOS


⸻

5️⃣ Example — ONIE Workflow

Build ONIE
   ↓
onie-installer.bin IMAGE
   ↓
Flash into device storage
   ↓
Boot ONIE
   ↓
Install NOS


⸻

6️⃣ Example — BIOS Firmware

Modify BIOS source
   ↓
Build BIOS firmware
   ↓
bios.rom IMAGE created
   ↓
Flash into SPI chip
   ↓
System boots new BIOS


⸻

7️⃣ Storage Where Images Are Flashed

Component	Stores
SPI flash	BIOS / ONIE
eMMC	NOS
SSD	Logs / images
NOR flash	Boot firmware


⸻

8️⃣ Flash vs Install

Term	Meaning
Flash	Write raw image
Install	Configure + deploy OS

ONIE installs NOS but flashes storage.

⸻

9️⃣ Build Systems Used

You’ll encounter:
	•	Make
	•	Yocto
	•	Buildroot
	•	Docker builds

They automate image creation.

⸻

🔟 Errors You’ll Hear

Common office phrases:
	•	“Build failed.” → Compilation issue
	•	“Image corrupted.” → Packaging issue
	•	“Flash failed.” → Write/storage issue
	•	“Wrong image flashed.” → Platform mismatch

⸻

1️⃣1️⃣ Visual Flow

Source code
   ↓ (Build)
Binary components
   ↓
Packaged IMAGE
   ↓ (Flash)
Written to hardware
   ↓
Bootable system


⸻

1️⃣2️⃣ Office-Ready Explanation

Beginner:

“Build creates software, image is the file, flash installs it.”

Expert:

“The build system compiles kernel, drivers, and rootfs into a deployable image which is flashed onto non-volatile storage for boot execution.”

⸻

🧠 Memory Shortcut

BUILD → Create software
IMAGE → Packaged file
FLASH → Write to hardware


⸻

If You Want Next Terms

Logical next jargon you’ll hear daily:
	•	Kernel
	•	Firmware
	•	Bootloader
	•	Rootfs
	•	Initrd
	•	Partition
	•	SDK
	•	Toolchain
	•	Cross-compilation

I’ll break them same clarity 👍
